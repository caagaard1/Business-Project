"""We witness large discontinuous changes in the front-month price at the end of each month, this is due to the rollover effect where in the
front-month contract changes to the new month which has been separately traded. In an attempt to combat this, giving us a smoother futures
curve, we will apply a in month weighting of the two futures contracts, the adjusted futures contract price will be found as:

M+1, adj = M+1 * (D_1 / M_0) + M+2 * (M_0 - D_1) / M_0
Where: D_1 is the days in the month until next month, M_0 is the total number of days in the month, M+2 is the month after the front-months futures contract

While this creates an artificial futures contract price that is not traded in real life, it will provide us with a much more smooth and
continuous function, allowing us to more robustly determine statistical properties and compare it with other continuous forms of information
such as interest rates, stock market indices, etc.

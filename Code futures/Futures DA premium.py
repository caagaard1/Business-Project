"""We witness large discontinuous changes in the front-month price at the end of each month, this is due to the rollover effect where in the
front-month contract changes to the new month which has been separately traded. In an attempt to combat this, giving us a smoother futures
curve, we will apply a in month weighting of the two futures contracts, the adjusted futures contract price will be found as:

M+1, adj = M+1 * (D_1 / M_0) + M+2 * (M_0 - D_1) / M_0
Where: D_1 is the days in the month until next month, M_0 is the total number of days in the month, M+2 is the month after the front-months futures contract

While this creates an artificial futures contract price that is not traded in real life, it will provide us with a much more smooth and
continuous function, allowing us to more robustly determine statistical properties and compare it with other continuous forms of information

3. The moving average premiums are heavily correlated with long-term behaviors (price and volatility) of day ahead prices

This would indicate that the premium on futures prices are more so dependent on the medium-term (7-60 days) market conditions which would
make intuitive sense given that the futures contract is for an entire month, meaning that while daily price movements give information
actors in the market are more concerned about medium-term behavior. 

However, we should also be cautious in interpreting the results directly, as the correlation between day ahead prices and the premium
is also somewhat mechanical, as the day ahead prices have been used in the calculation of the premium!!
